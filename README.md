# Braking-Simulation
Here is a braking simulation on different surfaces.
You have to write the characteristics of the vehicle (mass, velocity) and surface (type, conditions) and angle (degrees) of inclination of the road.
This is the line to call the arguments:                               
python Main().py --mass 1000 --velocity 20 --road_type concrete --wet_dry wet --inclination 10
